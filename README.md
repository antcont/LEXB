# LEXB corpus

The LEXB corpus is a bilingual (Italian-German) collection of South Tyrolean legislation.

The corpus is built in three versions:
- `LEXB_full`: a full version of the corpus, annotated with contextual, structural and linguistic information. The corpus is available for consultation on [corpora.dipintra.it]
- `LEXB_tm`: a raw version of the corpus to be used as a translation memory.
- `LEXB_mt`: a fully cleaned and filtered version of the corpus to be used for MT training and/or MT adaptation.
