# STPLC / LexCorpus
## South Tyrol Parallel Legal Corpus / LexCorpus

The STPLC (South Tyrol Parallel Legal Corpus) / LexCorpus is a bilingual collection of South Tyrolean legislation.

The corpus is built in three versions:
- `STPLC_full / LexCorpus_full`: a full version of the corpus, annotated with contextual, structural and linguistic information.
- `STPLC_tm / LexCorpus_tm`: a raw version of the corpus to be used as a translation memory.
- `STPLC_mt / LexCorpus_mt`: a fully cleaned and filtered version of the corpus to be used for MT training and MT adaptation.
